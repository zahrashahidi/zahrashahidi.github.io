abstract: "Public city bus services across various developing cities inhabit multiple stay-locations on the routes due to ad-hoc bus stops to provide on-demand passenger boarding and alighting services. Characterizing these stay-locations is essential to correctly develop models for bus transit patterns used in various digital navigation services. In this poster, we create a deep learning-driven methodology to characterize ad-hoc stay-locations over bus routes based on crowd-sensing contextual information. Experiments over 720km of bus travel data in a semi-urban city in India indicate promising results from the model in terms of good detection accuracy."
