Notebooks hold a special place in every data scientist's heart. They may treasure every moment creating their own, or commenting on others' notebooks. Or they may sincerely and truly hate notebooks. But notebooks are useful. How could we "imagineer" better notebooks? I’ve made and read hundreds of notebooks in the past decade. In this talk, I share key principles for developing happier notebooks – ones that are more fun to write, more fun to read, and more fun as an onramp to the next ride.
