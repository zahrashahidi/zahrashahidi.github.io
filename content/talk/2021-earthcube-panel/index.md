## Speakers

Kenton McHenry (University of Illinois) and Dan Katz (University of Illinois) will moderate a discussion with presenters:

- Alison Hill (RStudio), 
- Chris Holdgraf (2i2c - Jupyter), 
- Chris Erdmann (American Geophysical Union), and 
- Loren Shure (MathWorks - Matlab). 

The talks will focus on the latest developments in each of the presenters' technologies, emphasizing elements that support the notions of ease of use, long-term executability, interoperability, and software publication. Lessons learned from building a geoscience-focused notebook directory,  notebook template, and long-term preservation in AGUâ€™s ESSOaR will also be discussed - as well as how this all relates to international efforts to elevate notebooks and make them FAIR. This session has been designed for attendees that are already developing notebooks, those interested in doing so, and organizers who want to support these technologies in their events and proceedings.
