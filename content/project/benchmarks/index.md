The Benchmarks Report is a deep dive into how and why Voltron Data does benchmarking differently, and presents data comparing compute performance of our engine, Theseus, to Spark.

I led the development of the report, which involved industry/market research, subject matter expert interviews with engineers, and cross-functional strategic storytelling alignment with founders. I also drove the development of the interactive data visualizations, which were created by the talented [Tanya Shapiro](https://www.tanyashapiro.com/). This report defined our first feature launch for the Theseus engine in spring 2024, announced at Nvidia's GTC conference.
