The Composable Codex is a 5-part guide to building composable data systems layer by layer with open standards like Apache Arrow. I researched, wrote, and designed the Codex as part of my role on Voltron Data's Go-To-Market Strategy team. This initiative was the onramp to our first product launch for the Theseus engine in fall 2023.
