We present spatiotemporal measurements of air quality from 30 indoor sites over six months during the summer and winter seasons (89.1M samples, totaling 13646 hours of air quality data and 3957 activity annotations from 24 participants among 46 occupants). The sites are geographically located across four regions of type: rural, suburban, and urban, covering the typical low to middle-income population in India. The dataset contains various indoor environments (e.g., studio apartments, classrooms, research laboratories, food canteens, and residential households). Our dataset provides the basis for data-driven learning model research aimed at coping with unique pollution patterns in developing countries.

<b>Uniqueness:</b> This dataset offers extensive indoor air quality data from 30 indoor sites in developing Indian communities, annotated with daily activities and real-time pollution dynamics, filling a gap in large-scale datasets for developing nations.
* Multi-device: Contains pollution measurements from multiple devices per site, with up to six devices in residential households, offering unique observations of spread.
* Indoor types: Captures data from five types of locations (residential households, studio apartments, food canteens, classrooms, research labs) across 30 sites.
* Frequent pollutants: Includes readings for indoor temperature, humidity, and eight pollutants (CO2, VOC, PM1, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, C2H5OH, CO).
* Human annotations: Real-time activity labels collected via a speech-to-text app, providing necessary context for interpreting pollution readings.
* Multi-city deployment: Data from four regions in India, covering rural, suburban, and urban populations.
* Dataset duration: Data collected over six months (Summer and Winter), capturing seasonal pollution dynamics and behavioral variations.
