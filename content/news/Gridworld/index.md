The Grid-World package allows you to get your own table-based Reinforcement Learning-test environment with minimal line of code. You can interact with the environment and observe the emergent policy after the algorithm converges. The package provides:
* easy way to define an environment (see test.py)
* similar interface as openai-gym
* compitable with all model-free table-based RL-algorithm
