  I am a Director of Product at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), where I lead development of the [Core Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) enterprise and open-source products. I'm also a cognitive scientist with a Ph.D. in psychology, 1/3 of the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) team, a data scientist, an expert in data science education, and a mediocre website developer (I built this website and open-sourced my Hugo theme <3). 
  <br><br>I use this website to share about projects I am working on, and to write reflections about crafting kind tech tools.
